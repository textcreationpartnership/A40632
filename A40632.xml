            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>FAITH and REPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANCE are the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Conditions required on our part in order unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<pb facs="tcp:57119:3"/> Moſt hope for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but few that expect the benefit of the Covenant, will come up to the Terms of it. Some look upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as needleſs, and think to ſteal out of Sin, and ſpare the charges of it; moſt are remiſs in it: Many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume they believe, but few underſtand the Nature of Faith; and fewer live the Life of it. It is your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and will be your Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs for ever, that you live as underſtanding the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and believing the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of both.</p>

            <p>Indeed, the Ancient and Honourable Family from which you deſcend by your Father, and the Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily by your Mother, give you a high Place in the Civil Body; but that more Ancient and Noble Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Heaven, the General-Aſſembly, and Church of the Firſt-Born written there, to which by ſo living you are allied, gives you a higher Place in the Myſtical; Your ſincere Love to Religion, and unſhaken Stedfaſtneſs in it, give you an eſteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Wiſdom's Children,
<pb facs="tcp:57119:4"/> (the Friends of Religion,) will be your Honour while you live, and your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort when you die.

            <p>I am ſenſible how little You are pleas'd, that I tell You or the World this: But ſince it is ſo much your due, I ſhould be unjuſt if I did not; and no leſs ſhould I forget thoſe many ways

            <p>Upon this account it is, that Faith is a Grace of ſuch ſingular worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency: as a Quality, it has no more worth in it than any other Grace, (in ſome reſpects leſs) but as deſign'd to ſo <note place="margin">Manus mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans.</note> noble an Office, as that of juſtifying Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners before God (which no Grace elſe is) it has, and is preferr'd before all, it being as neceſſary to it <hi>(neceſſitate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii)</hi> as Chriſt himſelf; he as a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and Faith as a Means of applying him; for, we are not juſtified before we believe, nor by any thing but by believing.</p>

               <p>Then Damnation would be, not for want of Faith, but of Aſſurance, which is neceſſary, not for our Safety, but Comfort only; and Salvation would be by the reflex, and not by the direct Act of Faith, (for, Aſſurance conſiſts in a reflex Act) contrary to the tenure of the Promiſe of Salvation made,</p>

Without Humiliation, Faith is as a Houſe without a Foundation; and without Chriſt, it will, as a rotten Foundation, break under us; there is nothing to warrant or encourage our going to Chriſt before we are humbled, for we go before we are call'd, nor any thing to aſſure Salvation to us, if we do not go when we are; that, without him, cannot help us; he, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that, will not; for, we muſt be loſt, ſick, and damn'd in our own ſenſe and apprehenſion, before he will ſeek, heal, or ſave us.</p>

            <p>OUR firſt Parents fell by Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, and Self-ſeeking; and we riſe by Faith and Self-denial. Self-denial is of the Eſſence
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57119:40"/> of Chriſtianity, it is founded in the Nature of it, and we have no more of one, than we have of the other; it does not abound as the Stoical Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy did, with Improbable Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Contradictions, and Irreconcile-Paradoxes; yet with many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Reaſon, though with none con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it; things harſh and difficult to Fleſh and Blood. And that's the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Chriſt has ſo many idle Retainers, and ſo few true Servants; ſo many that follow him (as <hi>Peter</hi> once did) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 58.</note> off, and ſo few that keep cloſe to him, that will not (like Politick Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) ſtir an inch upon diſadvantage, nor venture (like wary Merchants) all in one Bottom; nor ſail ſo far into the Sea, (like thoſe that go thither for Pleaſure only) but that they may return when the Storm ariſes: They ſtudy more the Doctrine of Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation than of Self-denial; how they may keep all from Chriſt, rather than forſake any thing for him; and therefore will not venture their whole ſtock with him, leſt they ſhould (as they think) be undone by him. Many ſuch followed Chriſt for a time, when

A bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt will not entitle us to him; for all that outwardly profeſs him, muſt be Followers of him; nor a bare following of him neither; for, all his Followers muſt be Self-deniers: <note place="margin">Luke 9. 23.</note> therefore, to our Profeſſion of Chriſt, we muſt join following of him; and to both, add Self-denial, for it is the inſeparable Property of his Followers to be Self-deniers. This Self-denial, is a conſcionable neglect of our ſelves in all thoſe things that ſtand in oppoſition to our receiving of Chriſt, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of him; nothing ſtands more in oppoſition to theſe, than our ſinful and righteous Self; and nothing is with more defficulty denied, (it is no eaſy matter to get out of this enchanted Circle) but yet muſt be by all that are Chriſt's Diſciples, one, in reſpect of

            <p n="1" rend="indent">1. Sinful Self.</p>
            <p>Not that we muſt deſtroy our ſelves, that thereby we may deſtroy our Luſts: this would be to break one Command, that we might keep another; to Sin, that we might not Sin; to commit a greater; to avoid a leſs, and as vain, and fruitleſs as to attempt the expulſion of a ſtronger Poiſon by a weaker.</p>
            <p>But that we muſt deny Ungodlineſs <note place="margin">Titus 2. 12.</note> and worldly Luſts; ſuppreſs all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Motions, and avoid all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Occaſions leading to them, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve them in our Judgments, reſiſt them in our Wills, hate them in our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and depart from them in our Lives and Converſations; and this not at ſometimes only, but for ever, and not from ſome Luſts of the Fleſh only, but from all: for, as God hates all, and the Law curſes all, ſo Chriſt gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us, to redeem us from all; and <note place="margin">Titus 2. 14.

            <p>Repentance was a part of the ſum of Chriſt's Doctrine, (he taught the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity <note place="margin">Mat. 3.2. 4.17. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is the Foundation of all Goſpel-Righteouſneſs, that which diſpoſes for the receipt of Goſpel-Grace, (for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it we are uncapable of it) and that which ſhall continue as a neceſſary means (on our part) in order to it, as <note place="margin">Luke 24. 47.</note> long as the Goſpel ſhall continue.</p>
            <p>Repentance is not matter of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but Duty, whereby God is glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our Benefit, not to his; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, not as a Satisfaction to Juſtice, but as a Qualification for Mercy; not to merit it, (for <hi>Adam,</hi> before he ſinn'd, could not merit, much leſs then can we by our Repentance for it) but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to it, and goes neceſſarily before it.</p>
            <p>Not in the accidental Properties of it (they are uſually Antecedent, but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57119:47"/> not neceſſary): for, God by his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Royal, can in a moment work on the Heart.</p>
            <p>Nor in the exerciſe of it, (as in the Caſe of Children and Lunaticks): for, the Promiſe is made to the Principles of Grace.</p>
            <p>Nor in the ſeveral Meaſures of it: for, the Promiſe is made, not to the degree, but truth of Repentance; and it is not the weakneſs, but want of it that ruins.</p>
            <p>But in order of Nature, (the Sun is before the Beams, in order of Nature, and ſo is Repentance before Pardon) and as the Subject before the Adjunct: for, Repentance qualifies the Subject for Pardon, and makes it meet for it; not in a way of Merit, but Condecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, both to receive and prize it.</p>
            <p>The Means are before the End, <hi>(viz.</hi> in Execution; as the End is before the Means, in Intention); Union is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Mark 1. 4.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57119:48"/> that which is neceſſary to the renewing of Pardon (as Repentance is) is no leſs to the firſt procuring of it; and the contrary of that which makes us uncapable of Pardon, (as impenitency does) muſt neceſſarily (as Repentance does) go before it: For,</p>
            <p rend="italic indent">There can be no Remiſſion without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; no more than there can be any Salvation without Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p rend="indent">To aſſert the contrary,</p>
            <p>Deprives God of the Deſign of his Elective Love, (for Election is to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, as well as to Happineſs, and ſaves none without it) diveſts Chriſt of one of his Offices, <hi>(viz.</hi> his Regal Office) makes void the Office of the Spirit, as to its ſanctifying and comforting Work, (for, it gives neither Peace nor Joy in a way of Sin) robs Heaven of its greateſt Royalty, <hi>viz.</hi> Holineſs, (the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required on our part to make us meet for it); and declares, That God loves us better than himſelf, and ſaves us in contradiction to himſelf, (in that he loves and ſaves us in our Sins) and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57119:48"/> that Chriſt juſtifies Sinners to his own reproach, or rather juſtifies Sin than Sinners.</p>
            <p>It concerns us therefore, in all our Supplications for Mercy, to have an eye to the End of Mercy, to ſeek Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon the Terms of Mercy, <hi>viz.</hi> the Terms upon which it is offer'd, leſt we make Patents of Mercy to our ſelves, that God will never confirm: For,</p>
            <p rend="italic indent">As his Juſtice is wrong'd by a diſtruſt of Mercy upon Repentance; ſo his Mercy is abus'd by an expectation of it without it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We ſhould then admire the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing love of God to us.</p>
            <p>He paſſed by the Fallen Angels, (more excellent Creatures than we) and left them to periſh in their Sin, but has found out an Expedient for us by Repentance, to eſcape the Wrath due to it.</p>
            <p>The Devils cannot repent, nor are they aſſur'd of Pardon if they could; but ſinful Men are (the more happy they, and the more aſtoniſhing the freeneſs of Grace to them); they are
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57119:49"/> not call'd to Repentance, but theſe are, and aſſur'd of Pardon if they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but not unleſs they do: for, as Devils, and impenitent Sinners are alike in Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> in their ſinful, not in their created Nature, (alike as to kind, tho' not as to degree; both ſinful, but one more than the other) ſo they ſhall fare alike as to puniſhment.

            <p rend="italic indent">As a God of Mercy, he made the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and as a God of Truth, he will perform it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Since Repentance is the firſt Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that we are to learn under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, (it was the firſt in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1.</note>) and a Duty that we are daily
